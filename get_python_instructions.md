🐍 Setting Up Python on Windows
To run the Golf Playable Hours (GPH) Calculator, your computer needs the Python engine installed. Please follow these simple steps to get started:

1. Download the Official Installer
Go to the Official Python Downloads Page.

https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Under "Stable Releases," click the link for "Download Windows installer (64-bit)" for the latest version (e.g., Python 3.12 or 3.13).

2. Run the Installation (Crucial Step!)
Open the .exe file you just downloaded.

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT: At the bottom of the installation window, check the box that says:

"Add python.exe to PATH" (If you miss this step, the .bat file will not be able to find Python.)

Check the box for "Use admin privileges when installing py.exe".

Click Install Now.

3. Verify the Installation
Press the Windows Key on your keyboard, type cmd, and press Enter.

In the black window that appears, type the following and hit Enter: python --version

If you see "Python 3.x.x" as the result, you are ready to go!

4. Launch the GPH Calculator
Go back to the project folder and double-click run_GPH_app.bat.

The script will automatically handle the rest and open the calculator in your web browser.
